# Algoritmi e Strutture Dati
__Algoritmi e Strutture Dati tutoring repository @Units__

This repository contains all the python code implemented during the ASD lessons. 
Code runs with python 3.8.5 on Ubuntu 20.04, entering the following command: 
```bash
python3 nomeprogramma.py
```
The algorithms implemented consist of:
- `AlgoritmiLineari.py` where are implemented sorting algorithms that executed in linear time such as counting sort and bucket sort
- `BinHeap.py` where the binheap data-structure is implemented through a class
- `ExecutionTime.py` where is implemented a routine to plot the execution time of a given sorting algorithm 
- `QuickSelect.py` and `QuickSort.py` where are implemented the algorithms quick select and quick sort
- `avl.py` where the avl data-structure is implemented through a class
